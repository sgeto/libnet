Roadmap:

change all __WIN32  and __WIN32__ preprocessor directives with the more universal WIN32 and _WIN32 directives (msvc + mingw) (eliminating the need for -mwin32)

add INSTALL and edit README in libnet/README

short term goals:

I'm afraid the build system needs a complete overhaul.

improve documentation
- FAQ
- Examples
- add RFCs 

fix "broken" samples (on win32?)

fix MSVC/Mingw collision

increase warning level on all OS's when using "Build" top level script


long term goals:

build with the debug memory allocation or dmalloc library
http://dmalloc.com/
https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/html_node/Public-Macros.html (AM_WITH_DMALLOC)

implement netmap compatibilty https://github.com/luigirizzo/netmap

switch to npcap (win32)

come after as many reasonable issues in https://github.com/sam-github/libnet/issues/ and http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/libnet# as possible

Somethings not right with checksums...

improve LUA bindings

test and verify everything IPv6

Dynamic loading...
