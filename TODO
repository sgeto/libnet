Roadmap:

the --enable-samples option in configure never worked. And no one noticed... :(

add INSTALL and edit README in libnet/README

Is it "libnet" or "Libnet"? Can we please agree on one? All Uppercase or all lowercase!!
LIBNET or libnet

short term goals:

I'm afraid the build system needs a complete overhaul. 
Recursive "make" 
ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS=-I m4 in Makefile.am.common is not considered

improve documentation
- FAQ
- Examples
- add RFCs 

documentation is weird esp. libnet/doc/*.db
it needs to be build first or "make" will fail

fix "broken" samples (on win32?)

make mingw produce a dll's as well
libtool: warning: undefined symbols not allowed No Shared libraries support not available with x86_64-w64-mingw32; building static only

fix MSVC/Mingw collision

fix configure link-layer warning or implement win32 detection

increase warning level on all OS's when using "Build" top level script

make "Build" top level script

add link_layer_none.c and make sample building more link_layer_none friendly

long term goals:

come after as many reasonable issues in https://github.com/sam-github/libnet/issues/ and http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/libnet# as possible

Somethings not right with checksums...

improve LUA bindings

test and verify everything IPv6
