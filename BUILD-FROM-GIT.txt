I build from git using some top-level scripts. 
Refer to libnet/README.win32 if you're building for windows.

Minimum dependencies are:

	build-essential (obviously)
	autoconf
	libtool
	libpcap-dev
	doxygen

To create Debian package you also need:

	debhelper
	sharutils
	quilt

General procedure is:

    git clone .../libnet.git
    cd libnet/libnet
    ../Prepare
    ../Build

and then, one of the following, depending on how you like to install
local packages:

    sudo make install
    ../Stow
    ../Package
