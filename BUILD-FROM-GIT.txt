I build from git using some top-level scripts. 
Refer to libnet/INSTALL for additional information and
libnet/README.win32 if you're building for windows.

Minimum requirements are:

	build-essential (obviously)
	autoconf 2.69
	libtool 2.4.2
	libpcap-dev
	doxygen

To build LUA bindings:

	libdumbnet-dev (consider using my fork https://github.com/sgeto/libdnet)
	liblua5.1-0-dev

To create Debian packages you also need:

	debhelper
	sharutils
	quilt

General procedure is:

    git clone .../libnet.git
    cd libnet/libnet
    ../Prepare
    ../Build

and then, one of the following, depending on how you like to install
local packages:

    sudo make install
    ../Stow
    ../Package
